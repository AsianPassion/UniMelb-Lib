/* Exercise 6.3: Identifier scope and shadowing

ANSWERS:
=======

Function dumb returns the value of the input parameter dumb plus 1.

Function dumber returns 8. This is because the local variable dumber 
declared in the function shadows the input parameter dumber. The 
function always return dumb(6+1), which is 8.


The programmer who wrote the code should be sacked.
No matter how "clever" they are at using C's features, if they write
code that others cannot understand or that challenges the limits of
comprehension, then they shouldn't be allowed to remain in their job.


PS -- As it turns out, this code no longer compiles under gcc (it did
in 2002 when the first edition of the book was written).
That difference was not noted when the second edition was being
prepared in 2012, and so the question is itself now incorrect.
The author who wrote the book should be sacked.
