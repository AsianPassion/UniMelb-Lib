/* Exercise 4.2: Converting do loop to for loop

ANSWERS:
=======

The key to the conversion is that the statements in 
a do loop execute at least once, but there is no such 
guarantee in for loop. 

Let the do loop be: 

do {
	statements;
} (guard);

Then its equivalent for loop is: 

int first_time = 1;

for ( ; first_time || guard; ) {
	statements;
	
	first_time = 0;
}

Here, "first_time = 1" and "first_time || guard" allow
the statements in the for loop to execute at least once, 
and then "first_time = 0" gives the loop control to 
"guard" only (cause now "first_time" in "first_time || guard"
is always false). 

Alternatively, we can do the following to get rid of the 
extra variable first_time. 

for ( ; ; ) {
	statements;
	
	if (!guard) {
		break;
	}
}
