/* Exercise 3.2: The if-statement
   Jianzhong Qi, March 2013.
*/

ANSWERS:

=======

a. i = 7, j = 4


b. i = 3, j = 5, k = 9

	/* Note: logical operator precedence. */

c. days = 30  

	/* Note: the guard of the "else if" statement has a wrong syntax.
	   The correct one is:
	   month == 4 || month == 6 || month == 9 || month == 11
        */   

d. x = 2, y = 4

	/* Note: the usage of compound statements. */

e. x = 1, y = 2

   x = 2, y = 2

   x = 2, y = 4

	/* Note: there are ";"s after the if statements */
	
f. y is greater

	/* NOTE: the guard of the "else if" statement has a wrong syntax. 
	   The Assignment "y=x" returns the value of y, which is 0 (and
	   hence false), so "x and y are equal" will not be printed out.
           The correct guard is:
               y==x
        */
